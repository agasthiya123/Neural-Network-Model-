**MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification with TensorFlow**

**Project Overview:**

  This project implements a simple neural network using TensorFlow and Keras to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of digits (0-9) in grayscale 28x28 pixel format.

**Key Features:**

1. Data loading and preprocessing with normalization

2. Neural network model with one hidden dense layer using ReLU activation

3. Dropout layer for regularization to prevent overfitting

4. Training the model for 5 epochs using the Adam optimizer

5. Model evaluation on unseen test data to measure accuracy

**Environment & Setup:**

1. Developed and executed in Google Colab with GPU acceleration enabled for faster training

2. Requires TensorFlow 2.x and Matplotlib (optional for visualization)

3. Easy to run and modify for experimentation and learning purposes

**How to Run:**

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab.

2. Set the runtime to GPU: Runtime -> Change runtime type -> Hardware accelerator -> GPU.

3. Run each code cell sequentially to train and evaluate the model.

4. Modify model architecture and parameters as desired.

**Future Work:**

1. Extend to convolutional neural networks (CNN) for improved accuracy.

2. Incorporate hyperparameter tuning and model saving/loading.

3. Explore other datasets and advanced architectures.
